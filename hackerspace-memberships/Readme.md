 Every month, hackerspace has to pay its bills and every hacker has to pay his or her membership fee.

 Requirements: - Hackers in general don't pay their fees the same day every month, it's much more random.
 Bills however have to be paid on time. - The board wants monthly reports of the funds.

 Use share memory by communication approach (avoid mutexes).
