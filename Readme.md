# Exercise description 
During a busy hackaton 3D printers are heavily used. Write a simulation of hackers trying to access 3D printers.
In the hackerspace, there are 3 3D printers. There are 7 hackers that are interested in using the printers.
If the hacker can't access the printer for more than 5 seconds,
he gets annoyed and quits the hackaton. Hackers use printers for random interval
from 1 to 10 seconds and usually they need to use the printer at least twice, because nothing is perfect for the first time.

Note: This exercise corresponds to exercise 5 from [here](https://tinystruggles.com/2015/10/21/golang-concurrency.html)
